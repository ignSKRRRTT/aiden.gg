E-Z Host is a very customizable file-sharing platform that integrates into uploading tools to upload and share screenshots, video clips, and other files. E-Z Bio is a customizable bio link platform that's easy to set up and and allows users to have a full page with all of their socials in minutes.",

Tsoxas joined early on and helped carry the site through its first stages, developing a custom backend and adding new features. Eventually I leared how to code and now here we are today."
